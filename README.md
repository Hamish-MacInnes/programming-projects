# python and C projects
map.py : Incomplete project wherein the goal is to navigate a horseshoe-shaped maze and reach the end.
The player can't progress further than one tile due to a bug. 

new1.c : this program prints hello world, then asks your name and returns it. Intended as part of an intro to a game.

patients.py : this project showcases both use of different datatypes and use of a dictionary. 
Each patient attribute, his name (string), age (integer) and whether he is a preexisting patient or a new patient (boolean) uses a different datatype. The list is then printed from a dictionary, which sorts the attributes in alphabetical order. 

test.py : fizzbuzz in python.
